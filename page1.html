    <h2>Experience with Web Development</h2>

    <p>
      I have no experience with web development and have never used HTML or CSS before.
      The closest I have come to "web development/design" is through using website
      builders such as Weebly.com.  This will be my first time learning about web design
      in a formal academic setting.

    <h2>What do I Hope to Learn</h2>

    <p>
      I have always been interested in what all the code meant when you hit F12 and
      opened up the browser devleper tools.  I am very interested to learn about how
      to code using HTML and CSS as well as using JavaScript.  Learning JavaScript will be
      especially useful to me since GeoGebra allows you to write code using JavaScript.
